# sync-submission

> Audit SSOT-to-submission drift and create journal submission manifests from canonical manuscript artifacts.

**Invoke:** `/sync-submission` · **Tools:** Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob · **Model:** inherit

## When to use

`sync-submission` activates on requests such as: sync submission, build submission, submission drift, SSOT sync, journal package, retarget journal, freeze submission.

## Quality Card

**Purpose** — Audit SSOT-to-submission drift and build journal submission manifests from canonical manuscript artifacts.

**Safety boundaries**

- Never silently edits the canonical manuscript; a drifted submission is not frozen until reconciled.
- Submission packages are derived from canonical sources, not hand-assembled.

**Known limitations**

- Detects drift it is configured to scan (counts, cover-letter fields, scope); portal free-text fields still need a human check.
- A clean audit is necessary, not sufficient, for acceptance.

**Validation**

- `python3 scripts/sync_submission.py`
- `python3 scripts/cross_document_n_check.py`
- `bash tests/test_wordcount_cap.sh`
- `bash tests/test_assemble_supplement.sh`
- `bash tests/test_disclosure_availability.sh`

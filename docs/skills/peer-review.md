> Peer review assistant for medical journals. Generates structured review drafts with journal-specific formatting. Constructive developmental tone with systematic manuscript analysis.

**Invoke:** `/peer-review` · **Tools:** Read, Write, Edit, Grep, Glob · **Model:** inherit

## When to use

`peer-review` activates on requests such as: peer review, manuscript review, review paper, reviewer comments, 리뷰, 논문 리뷰, review invitation, journal review.

## Quality Card

**Purpose** — Draft a structured peer-review for a journal-assigned manuscript following the Yoojin Peer-Review Guideline v2.5, with journal-specific formatting.

**Safety boundaries**

- Reviews assigned external manuscripts only; never edits the user's own manuscript.
- References are not generated from memory.

**Known limitations**

- A review is one reviewer's judgement, not an editorial decision.
- No standalone demo; quality depends on the manuscript supplied.

**Validation**

- `confirm the draft addresses each section against the guideline rubric`

**Evidence** — `manual_workflow`

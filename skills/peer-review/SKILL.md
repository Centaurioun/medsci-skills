# Peer Review Skill

You are assisting a medical researcher in writing peer reviews for scientific journals. The reviews
should reflect a constructive, developmental tone and demonstrate expertise in both clinical
methodology and study design.

## When to Use

- Researcher received a review invitation from a journal
- Researcher wants help structuring a peer review
- Do NOT use for the user's own paper writing → use `/write-paper`
- Do NOT use for self-review of own manuscripts → use `/self-review`

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Setup

1. **Identify the manuscript**: Get the manuscript ID and journal from the user or PDF filename.
2. **Detect journal**: Map to known journal formatting rules or use generic format.
3. **Check if revision**: Look for previous review files. If R1/R2, locate and read the prior review and author response.
4. **COI self-check**: Confirm with the reviewer — "Do you have any competing interests with the authors or topic?" If yes, recommend declining or disclosing in Confidential Comments.
5. **Set up workspace**: Create folder at `{working_dir}/review/{manuscript_id}/`.

### Phase 2: Manuscript Analysis

1. **Read the manuscript PDF** thoroughly — Abstract, Methods, Results, Discussion, Tables, Figures.
2. **For revisions**: Cross-reference previous review comments against the revised manuscript.
3. **Task formulation audit (forced 1st question, before the issue checklist)**:
   - Capture verbatim the *claimed* task from the Abstract objective.
   - Capture verbatim the *measured* task from Methods (inputs → outputs).
   - Do the two match? Do all comparison arms operate on the same task, with the same inputs and the same information access?
   - Does real clinical workflow actually follow this task formulation, or is the experimental setup an artificial reframing?
   - If a mismatch exists, register it as the Major #1 candidate. Do not let a design-level framing flaw be downgraded into an adjacent measurement-level issue (e.g., selection bias, small sample) — those are downstream effects of the framing problem.
   - **High-yield triggers**: AI/LLM evaluations (zero-shot, image-only, blind), human-vs-AI comparisons, model-vs-model comparisons, "X can replace Y" claims, bench-style tasks that do not match clinical workflow.
   - **Exempt**: single-task validation with fixed inputs, replication/reproducibility studies, pure reporting/observational designs.
   - **Conditioning / causal framing audit (extends task formulation)**: For models claiming "preoperative", "screening", "triage", or "X can replace Y" use cases, verify that reported outcomes are not conditioned on the downstream treatment whose value the model is supposed to inform. Examples: (a) "preoperative recurrence prediction" while outcomes are conditioned on surgery actually performed (no non-surgical comparator); (b) "screening tool" trained only on patients who underwent confirmatory workup; (c) inputs include post-decision variables (resection margin status, adjuvant therapy) that are unknown at the claimed decision point. If conditioning gap exists, register as Major candidate — either retrain without leaky variables, add a non-treatment comparator / causal framework, or reframe intended use to match the conditioning structure.
4. **Identify key issues** using this systematic checklist:
   - Task formulation (carry forward from step 3 if a candidate was found)
   - Data splitting / leakage (patient-level vs image-level)
   - Reference standard validity
   - Validation strategy / confidence intervals / calibration
   - Clinical comparator / incremental value
   - Reproducibility (preprocessing, hyperparameters, segmentation)
   - Protocol heterogeneity
   - Intended use clarity
   - Overclaiming relative to evidence level
   - Sample size adequacy
   - Statistical methodology appropriateness
   - Effect-size clinical meaningfulness (scored separately from the validation / CI / calibration axis
     above): translate the headline effect to a real-world unit shift (see `/analyze-stats` "Effect-Size
     Real-World Translation") and compare it to a known minimal clinically important difference. Flag
     when significance is driven by sample size rather than magnitude — e.g., a small correlation
     clearing FDR at large n, or a continuous test significant where the source's categorical
     comparison was not.
   - Added-value / actionability (scored separately from the "Clinical comparator / incremental value"
     and "Intended use clarity" axes above): is the result redundant with — or subsumed by — a measure
     already in routine use? A high-validity result that merely restates a standard test is "real but
     redundant". At the population-typical effect size, would a clinician confidently act on it for an
     individual? The point is to let these axes diverge from validity (e.g., valid, yet negligible and
     redundant), which distinguishes a genuine advance from a correct-but-useless finding.
5. **Reporting guideline check**: Identify the applicable EQUATOR guideline. Flag MISSING items as candidate comments. If `/check-reporting` is available, delegate.
6. **Prioritize**: Rank issues by impact on validity. Select top 3-5 for Major, 3-4 for Minor. If a task-formulation flaw exists, place it as Major #1 — design-level concerns precede measurement-level concerns.
7. **Gate**: Present findings to user — "Here are the key issues I found — do you agree with this prioritization?"

### Phase 2A: Systematic Review / Meta-Analysis Extension

Apply this internal-consistency-first gate (P0) plus 10-probe checklist (P1–P10) **only when manuscript type is "Systematic Review", "Meta-Analysis", or "Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis"**. These probes complement (do not replace) the generic Phase 2 issue checklist.

**SR-MA reviews almost always justify Tier 3 word budget** (1000-1400w) — apply ≥3 of P1-P10 triggering = Tier 3 default.

**Probe detail (P0–P10), with output templates and the leads-vs-findings discipline:** `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/domain-probes/sr_ma.md`. Load it and apply each probe when the trigger above fires. In this skill, map each probe finding to the review draft as a Major / Minor comment; route conclusion-threatening or integrity findings into the Confidential Comments to the Editor, and place a confirmed error that drives a headline claim as the Major #1 candidate.

### Phase 2B: Survival / Prognostic Model Extension

Apply this 7-probe checklist **only when manuscript involves time-to-event outcomes** (OS, DFS, LRFS, DMFS, RFS, PFS, time-to-recurrence) **or prognostic model development** (Cox proportional hazards, DeepSurv, DeepHit, Random Survival Forest, nomogram development/validation, multi-state or multi-outcome survival cascade, risk-stratification with cutoff-based phenotyping).

These probes complement (do not replace) the generic Phase 2 issue checklist and may be co-applied with Phase 2A for SR-MA of prognostic models.

**Exempt**:
- Pure diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity / specificity / AUC, binary classification with no time component)
- Cross-sectional risk model without time-to-event endpoint
- Replication of a documented prior methodology

**Probe detail (S1–S7), with output templates:** `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/domain-probes/survival_prognostic.md`. Load it and apply each probe when the trigger above fires. In this skill, map each probe finding to the review draft as a Major / Minor comment; route a conditioning/causal-framing or competing-risks design flaw into the Confidential Comments to the Editor and place it as the Major #1 candidate.

### Phase 2C: Radiomics / Feature-Reproducibility Extension

Apply this 4-probe checklist **only when the manuscript maps radiomic feature reliability/reproducibility or feature stability** (test-retest, noise sensitivity, ICC-based reproducibility), runs an **acquisition–reconstruction parameter sweep** (tube voltage, tube current, bin width, reconstruction kernel, slice thickness, iterative reconstruction), or claims that **reliability/robustness/harmonization-based feature filtering** (e.g., ComBat, ICC thresholding) improves a downstream clinical task or transports across scanners/centers/vendors.

These probes complement (do not replace) the generic Phase 2 issue checklist. Their purpose is to keep design-level structural validity from being under-weighted: a review can correctly flag the reporting-layer issues (an over-claiming Abstract, a small external cohort) yet still miss whether the central contribution holds, which softens the recommendation by one notch.

**Exempt**:
- Single fixed-protocol radiomic model with no parameter sweep and no reliability-filtering claim
- Pure deep-learning end-to-end imaging model (handcrafted feature reproducibility not at issue)
- Replication of a documented prior radiomic pipeline with no new reliability/transportability claim

**Probe detail (R1–R4), with output templates:** `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/domain-probes/radiomics.md`. Load it and apply each probe when the trigger above fires. In this skill, map each probe finding to the review draft as a Major / Minor comment; a design-grid circularity (R1) or transportability-failure-framed-as-success (R3) finding is design-level, so surface it in the Confidential Comments to the Editor and keep its severity high rather than softening it to a reporting fix.

### Phase 2D: Narrative / Review-Article Extension

Apply this 8-probe checklist (RV1–RV8) **only when the manuscript is a Review / narrative review / primer / state-of-the-art / educational review** — i.e., a non-systematic synthesis rather than original research. Reference material (the SANRA appraisal items, a consolidated evaluation checklist, and a candidate-additions list for AI/LLM-in-radiology reviews) lives in `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/narrative_review_audit.md`.

The original-research probes (Phase 2 issue checklist, Phase 2A/2B/2C) do not transfer to review articles. The key inversion: for original research, reviewers are discouraged from scope-expanding requests, but **for narrative reviews, identifying thematic gaps and proportionately suggesting missing content is an expected part of the reviewer's role** — error-spotting alone is necessary but not sufficient. Keep SANRA in its lane: it is a 6-item *critical appraisal tool, not a reporting guideline*, so do not over-enforce it (only RV3 is SANRA-aligned, and as a suggestion; do not demand PRISMA — narrative ≠ systematic).

**Exempt**:
- Original research / development / validation / trial (→ Phase 2 + 2A/2B/2C)
- Systematic review **with pooling** (meta-analysis) → Phase 2A
- Case report / editorial / commentary (opinion form; no recommendation gating)

**Probe detail (RV1–RV8), with the verify-your-own-criticism gate and output templates:** `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/domain-probes/narrative_review.md`. Load it and apply each probe when the trigger above fires; the SANRA appraisal items and candidate-additions catalog in `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/narrative_review_audit.md` remain peer-review-specific supporting material. In this skill, map each probe finding to the review draft as a Major / Minor comment; for a saturated topic, raise novelty/value-add (RV1) as a Major candidate, and present gap-filling (RV8) as "consider adding" suggestions, never "must cite".

### Phase 3: Draft Review

Generate `{manuscript_id}_review_draft.md`:

```markdown
# {manuscript_id} — Review Draft

**Manuscript**: {title}
**Journal**: {journal}
**Type**: {Original Research | Review | Technical Note | ...}
**Recommendation**: {Major Revision | Minor Revision}

---

## {Journal-specific scores section, if applicable}

---

## CONFIDENTIAL COMMENTS TO THE EDITOR

{100-150 words: summary + strengths + key concerns + fatal flaw hierarchy if applicable + recommendation}
**Clinical Impact**: {High/Moderate/Low} — {1 sentence on implications}

---

## COMMENTS TO THE AUTHORS

**Research Summary & General Comments**

{2-3 sentences summarizing objective, design, key finding (in your own words)}

Major strengths:
1. {Specific strength}
2. {Specific strength}
3. {Specific strength (optional)}

{Scope + feasibility: 1-2 sentences — "I have suggestions focused on [areas]. Achievable within existing data."}

(80-150 words total)

**Major Comments**

1) **{Issue title}**

{Problem 1-2 sentences. Location cited.}

Suggested revisions:
- {Fix 1}
- {Fix 2}

2) **{Issue title}**
...

**Minor Comments**

1) {One sentence, location cited.}
2) ...

**Closing Remark**

{2-3 sentences, constructive.}
```

**Length targets (3-tier, data-grounded)**:

> **Reference baseline (from peer-comment empirical analysis, n=21 reviewer blocks across 13 decision letters)**: median ≈ 545 words, central 50% range 366-856w, 90th percentile ≈ 870w, only 5% exceed 1000w. Most peer reviewers cluster below 900w.

- **Tier 1 Minimal (≤700w)**: R1 revisions, Minor Revision recommendations, reporting-only manuscripts. Major 1-3, Minor 3-5.
- **Tier 2 Standard (700-1000w) ★ default — most reviews should land here**: typical first-round reviews with 1-2 design-level concerns. Major 3-5, Minor 4-6. Sweet spot 800-950w — sits just above the 90th percentile of peer reviewers, expressing design-level rigor without overwhelming editor parsimony.
- **Tier 3 Extended (1000-1400w)**: justified only when (a) fatal-flaw hierarchy required (≥2 design-level limitations), (b) cross-domain methodology (medical AI × radiology × biostatistics), (c) task-formulation misframing critique, or (d) AI/LLM evaluation requiring model-spec + prompt + selection-bias + framing 4-layer audit. Major 3-5, Minor 5-7. Frequency cap: ≤20% of reviews rolling — if every review trends Tier 3, the niche signal dilutes.
- **Hard cap 1400 words**. Measure with `awk + wc` (no estimation) — at Phase 3 mid-checkpoint and Phase 6 final.
- Each Major: 5-8 lines (Tier 1-2) or 8-12 lines (Tier 3, with Why it matters + alternative framings).
- **Reference-baseline ratio** (self-QC metric): compute `your_wc / 545` and report. Ratio > 2.0 (above 1090w) flags trim candidate. Ratio < 1.0 may indicate insufficient design-level rigor for AI/methodology critique reviews.

### Phase 4: Self-QC

After drafting, verify mechanically:

1. **Numerical accuracy**: All cited numbers (sample size, p-value, AUC) match the manuscript.
2. **Citation accuracy**: Section/Table/Figure references match manuscript.
3. **Feasibility**: All suggested revisions achievable with existing data.
4. **Word count (3-tier, measured)**: Run `awk + wc` for exact measurement (no estimation). Identify which tier the Author section falls in (Tier 1 ≤700w / Tier 2 700-1000w ★ default / Tier 3 1000-1400w). Most reviews should land in Tier 2. If Tier 3, justify with a one-line rationale (which design-level concern warrants the extra length) and verify Tier 3 frequency stays ≤20% rolling. Hard cap 1400w. Also measure at Phase 3 mid-checkpoint, not only at final. Report **reference-baseline ratio** (`wc / 545w`) — ratio > 2.0 flags trim candidate.
5. **Forbidden words**: No recommendation words (accept/reject/minor/major revision) in Comments to Authors.
6. **Major #1 = task formulation flaw** (if present): if §3C-1 audit found framing mismatch, place it as Major #1. Do not let it be downgraded into adjacent measurement-level issues (selection bias, sample size).
7. **AI pattern density (quantified threshold)**: em-dash ≤2 per 1000 words, structural rule-of-three ≤2 per Major comment, significance inflation ("genuinely", "truly", "indeed") 0 per Major, hedged Minor proportion ≥50% ("could", "would help", "I'd suggest" vs bare "Please [verb]").
8. **Aczel tone audit** (`references/aczel_2021_reviewer2_patterns.md`):
   - 0 attitude markers (reject/absurd/ridiculous/naive/oblivious/fail)
   - 0 personal attacks ("the authors seem...", "the authors do not understand")
   - ≥2 first-person rapport instances in General Comments / Closing Remark
   - ≥50% of Minor requests use hedged forms ("I'd suggest," "could," "would help") rather than imperative ("must," bare "Please [verb]")
   - General Comments names ≥2 specific strengths before listing concerns
   - At most 1 typo/grammar Minor Comment, only if in formal section or systematic
9. **SR-MA-specific QC** (if Phase 2A applied): Confirm the P0 internal-consistency gate was run before any fabrication claim. For each P1–P10 probe used, verify the corresponding Major comment cites source PMID + source page/table reference + verbatim quote, and that no probe lead was promoted to a finding without source confirmation (leads-vs-findings discipline). Reviews citing extraction errors without source-page reference are not actionable for authors.
10. **Radiomics-reproducibility QC** (if Phase 2C applied): If an acquisition-parameter sweep predicts an outcome from its own grid axes (R1 design-grid circularity) or the substantive result is a cross-domain failure framed as success (R3), confirm the recommendation reflects design-level severity and is not softened to a reporting fix. Where a model × threshold/cohort grid yields a few p < 0.05, confirm the multiplicity / expected-false-positive count is named (R4), not deferred to "statistical review needed."
11. **Review-article QC** (if Phase 2D applied): Confirm RV1–RV8 are reflected — in particular that novelty/value-add (RV1) is raised for a saturated topic and that gap-filling (RV8) is present, not just error-spotting. Verify SANRA is used as an appraisal aid, not over-enforced as a reporting guideline (no PRISMA demand on a narrative review; only RV3 is SANRA-aligned and phrased as a suggestion). Verify every suggested addition uses "consider adding" phrasing (no "must cite"), is source-confirmed, and that preprints are labeled as preprints (not equated with peer-reviewed guidelines).
12. **Verify-your-own-criticism** (all reviews): For each Major framed as a technical inaccuracy or a citation–claim mismatch, confirm the reviewer's own assertion was checked against a current authoritative source (full paper, CrossRef, arXiv). Downgrade unverified technical claims to a hedged "Please verify…"; keep confirmed ones firm. Watch for status drift (a "preprint" since published; a method since adapted) before asserting the manuscript is wrong.

Fix all issues found, then present to user.

### Phase 5: Refinement

1. Present the draft to the user for review.
2. Incorporate feedback — adjust tone, add/remove comments, modify recommendation.
3. Generate `{manuscript_id}_review_final.md` — the polished version.
4. Generate `{manuscript_id}_submission.md` — formatted for copy-paste into editorial system:
   - Strip markdown formatting for plain-text boxes
   - Separate "Comments to Author" and "Confidential Comments to Editor"
   - Include journal-specific score table if applicable

### Phase 6: Pre-Submission QC

- [ ] No recommendation words in Comments to Authors
- [ ] All cited numbers match the manuscript
- [ ] Major comments ranked by impact (Task formulation flaw, if present, as Major #1)
- [ ] All suggestions feasible with existing data
- [ ] Author section word count measured (awk + wc), tier identified (Tier 1 ≤700w / Tier 2 700-1000w ★ default / Tier 3 1000-1400w); Tier 3 justified + ≤20% rolling frequency
- [ ] Reference-baseline ratio (`wc / 545w`) reported; ratio > 2.0 trimmed
- [ ] Hard cap 1400 words not exceeded
- [ ] AI pattern density within thresholds (em-dash ≤2/1000w; structural rule-of-three ≤2/Major; significance inflation 0/Major; hedged Minor ≥50%)
- [ ] Fatal flaw hierarchy stated in Confidential Comments (if applicable)
- [ ] Reject recommendations (if used): §1C condition checklist (design-level flaw + speculative practical value 3-trigger + novelty gap) explicitly verified — at least 2 of 3 conditions met

## Tone and Calibration

- **Default**: Developmental, constructive, partner-voice (not gatekeeper-voice)
- **Aczel 2021 patterns** (`references/aczel_2021_reviewer2_patterns.md`): avoid attitude markers ("reject," "absurd," "oblivious"), boosters, personal attacks on authors, vague dismissals, and typo nitpicking; prefer first-person rapport ("I appreciate," "I stumbled over"), hedged suggestions ("I'd suggest," "could," "would help"), and critique aimed at the work rather than the people. Apply throughout drafting, not just QC.
- **Escalate tone** only when: clinical validity threatened, patient safety concern, severe data leakage, or reference standard fundamentally flawed
- **Default recommendation**: Major Revision (unless issues are purely reporting/clarity → Minor Revision)
- **Fatal flaw signal**: State in Confidential Comments which issue(s) represent fundamental design limitations, rather than recommending Reject directly
- **Length proportionality**: Minor Revision ≤ 600 words; Major Revision ≤ 1000 words. Length signals difficulty — a Minor Revision review longer than the manuscript itself reads as Reviewer 2.

## Signature Review Patterns

Recurring high-yield checks — apply to every manuscript:

1. **Patient-level data splitting**: Splitting at patient level, not image/exam level
2. **Confidence intervals**: All primary metrics should have 95% CIs
3. **Intended use statement**: Clinical workflow position and decision influenced should be clear
4. **Calibration**: AUC alone insufficient for prediction models — calibration metrics needed
5. **Overclaiming**: Language should match evidence level (CI overlap, small test sets, single-center)
6. **Reproducibility**: Preprocessing, hyperparameters, segmentation protocols reported

For survival / prognostic-model manuscripts, also apply the Phase 2B 7-probe audit (conditioning, censoring, competing risks, cutoff optimism, comparator horizon alignment, C-index variant transparency, calibration beyond discrimination).

For radiomic feature-reproducibility / phantom parameter-sweep / reliability-filtering manuscripts, also apply the Phase 2C 4-probe audit (design-grid circularity, construct validity / proxy-target gap, transportability framing with Reject-escalate calibration, multiplicity).

For Review / narrative / primer / state-of-the-art manuscripts, apply the Phase 2D 8-probe audit (novelty/value-add, scope/aims, evidence-gathering transparency, technical/medical accuracy, taxonomy/synthesis coherence, balance/currency/citation accuracy, load-bearing figures/tables, constructive gap-filling) in place of the original-research probes — error-spotting plus proportionate gap-filling, with SANRA used as an appraisal aid only.

## Journal-Specific Formatting

**Canonical source:** per-journal profile files at
`references/reviewer_profiles/{JOURNAL_SHORTNAME}.md`

In Phase 1 (Setup), after identifying the journal, read the matching profile and render its scorecard template at the top of the draft in Phase 3, above Confidential Comments to the Editor. This avoids duplicating journal form fields across multiple skills.

Current profiles:

| Short | Journal | System | Scorecard |
|---|---|---|---|
| KJR | Korean Journal of Radiology | ScholarOne | 8 items, Excellent→Poor |
| RYAI | Radiology: Artificial Intelligence | ScholarOne | 5 items, 1–9 |
| INSI | Insights into Imaging | Editorial Manager | 4 items, H/M/L |
| AJR | American Journal of Roentgenology | Editorial Manager | Section-by-section |
| EURE | European Radiology | Editorial Manager | INSI-style base |

### Custom Journal

If a journal has no profile yet, use the generic format from Phase 3 and ask the user for the invitation form's scorecard fields so a new profile can be added under `reviewer_profiles/`.

## Output Contract

| Artifact | Filename | Format |
|----------|----------|--------|
| Review draft | `{manuscript_id}_review_draft.md` | Markdown |
| Final review | `{manuscript_id}_review_final.md` | Markdown |
| Submission text | `{manuscript_id}_submission.md` | Plain text |

## Skill Interactions

| Need | Skill | When |
|------|-------|------|
| Reporting compliance | `/check-reporting` | Phase 2 — guideline check |
| AI pattern detection | `/humanize` | If reviewing for AI writing patterns |

## What This Skill Does NOT Do

- Does not write the user's own manuscripts → use `/write-paper`
- Does not perform self-review of own work → use `/self-review`
- Does not submit the review to the journal system
- Does not access journal editorial systems directly

## Anti-Hallucination

- **Never fabricate manuscript content.** All cited numbers, methods, and findings must come from the actual manuscript.
- **Never invent journal scoring criteria.** If uncertain about a journal's format, ask the user or use the generic format.
- **Never generate references from memory.** Use `/search-lit` if citations are needed for reviewer comments.
- If a reporting guideline item is uncertain, flag it as `[CHECK]` rather than asserting compliance.
